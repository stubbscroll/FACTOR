Here be a list of relevant literature for integer factorization, with a brief
commentary.


===============================================================================
MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Learning algebraic number theory (Sam Ruth, 2010)

A "meta-article" which is a list of relevant background topics before learning
algebraic number theory. Algebraic number theory is needed to fully understand
the number field sieve. For each topic, suggested literature is given. If the
only goal is to understand enough math to implement the number field sieve,
this list is overkill and you can get away with much less (for instance,
everything that comes after 3.1 can be skipped).


===============================================================================
GENERAL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the complexity of computing discrete logarithms and factoring integers
(A M Odlyzko, around 1985?)

Discussion of the time complexity of various factorization algorithms, based
on the complexity of solving the matrix step. It's written before NFS came
along, and probably also before the blocked variants of Lanczos and Wiedemann.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Massively distributed computing and factoring large integers (Robert D
Silverman, 1991) ["pracnique"]

Overview of factoring algorithms aimed at a slightly more general scientific
audience, so the usage of math is more gentle than the factorization literature
in general. Contains a bit of general history relevant to factorization. Pretty
much ever major factorization algorithm is mentioned.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A survey of modern integer factorization algorithms (Peter L Montgomery, 1994)

Description of the common factorization algorithms, with some improvements
mentioned (for example Brent's improvement to Pollard Rho, the large prime
bound of P-1 and multiple polynomials and large prime variations in quadratic
sieve). The algebraic square root step of NFS is not described. Includes
examples, although the NFS example uses polynomials based on a special
observation, which is rather uncommon.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A tale of two sieves (Carl Pomerance, 1996)

A "popular scientific"-ish article about the history of CFRAC, QS and NFS. An
easy-ish read, and some potentially scary math enters in the NFS explanation.
No implementation details.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some parallel algorithms for integer factorisation (Richard P Brent, 1999)

Discussion of several parallelization algorithms and how (and how good) they
can be parallelized. Pollard rho, Pollard p-1, ECM, MPQS, SNFS and NFS are
discussed. The parallelization-friendly algorithms are ECM (each trial/curve is
embarassingly parallel), MPQS and NFS (except the linear algebra step). 
Implementation tips are given for parallel arbitrady precision arithmetic.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Integer factoring (Arjen K Lenstra, 2000)

Survey of factorization algorithms that begins with a review of modular
arithmetic, smooth numbers and probabilistic primality tests and continue with
descriptions of "special purpose algorithms" (trial division, Pollard's rho,
Pollard's p-1, the elliptic curve method (ECM) and Fermat's method) and
"general purpose algorithms" (Morrison-Brillhart approach (exemplified via
Dixon's random squares rather than CFRAC), quadratic sieve (QS) and number
field sieve (NFS)). There is run-time analysis for each algorithm. The
descriptions of ECM and NFS omit a lot of the math and the advanced
subalgorithms, but there is still a high-level description of lattice sieving.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Integer factorization (Per Leslie Jensen, 2005) [master's thesis]

Brief descriptions of the most common factorization algorithms, such as trial
division, Pollard's p-1, Pollard's rho (with Brent's improvements), elliptic
curve method, CFRAC and quadratic sieve, as well as a brief review of most of
the mathematical background (not in-depth, no proofs) and a short review of
public key cryptography. The main focus is on a nice, beginner-friendly and
comprehensive description of the number field sieve, with an emphasis on
implementation-friendliness. Only the "easy" variation of each step is
described, which means classical sieve, regular gaussian elimination and
an easy-looking algebraic square root algorithm which is probably the old,
inefficient Hensel lifting algorithm. There is an example of a complete
factorization as well, which includes all steps in great detail. There is also
a separate section dedicated to implementation details. This is a good starting
point for learning NFS.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modern factoring algorithms (Bimpikis, Jaiswal, 2005)

An overview of some factorization algorithms, with short explanations of
Pollard rho (with Brent's improvements and also with examples), quadratic
sieve, plus a much larger section describing the number field sieve, which also
includes a review of the background math. Throughout they "pretend" that
ideals have unique factorization in Z[theta], which is only true in general for
the ring of algebraic integers O_Q(theta). In addition there is a
section describing Shor's polynomial time quantum computer factorization
algorithm. There are runtime analyses for each algorithm. There are some
typos in examples.


===============================================================================
GENERAL-factorization estimates
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The future of integer factorization (Andrew M Odlyzko, 1995)

Discussion on how large the RSA modulus one should select, based on how large
integers one could possibly factor (also taking into account community
efforts, Moore's law and allowing some slack for algorithmic improvements).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Factoring estimates for a 1024-bit RSA modulus (A Lenstra, Dodson, Hughes,
Kortsmit, Leyland, 2003)

Estimate of the difficulty and time it will take to factor 1024-bit RSA
moduli, based on estimated yields in the sieve stage.

Kaihara, Kleinjung, A Lenstra, Montgomery, 2009)

Includes rough estimates on how long it would take to factor a 1024-bit RSA
modulus, as well as discussion about special purpose hardware for the same
task.


===============================================================================
POLLARD RHO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An improved Monte Carlo factorization algorithm (Richard P Brent, 1980)

Describes Brent's improvements to Pollard's Rho algorithm with a faster
cycle-finding algorithm and fewer gcd computations.


===============================================================================
ECM (Lenstra's elliptic curve factorization method)


===============================================================================
ECM-improvements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Speeding the Pollard and elliptic curve methods of factorization (Peter L
Montgomery, 1987)

Speedups for Pollard's rho, p-1 and p+1 methods, and for ECM. This document is
very dense and contains a ton of various optimizations that mostly reduce the
number of expensive mathematical operations (multiplication, inversion).
Pseudocode is given for most of the improved algorithms. The Montgomery
elliptic curve representation is introduced in this document, and it requires
no inversions as long as the necessary precalculation is performed.


===============================================================================
QS (quadratic sieve)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The multiple polynomial quadratic sieve (Robert D Silverman, 1987)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Factoring with two large primes (A Lenstra, Manasse, 1994)

Description of a QS variant that uses two large primes, and how to combine
partial relations (1 large prime) and partial-partial relations (2 large
primes) into full relations. rich on implementation tips, including very
detailed description of the relation combination stage, which uses cycle
detection in a graph created from the partial(-partial) relations.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Factoring integers with the self-initializing quadratic sieve (Scott Patrick
Contini, 1997) [master's thesis]

Great introduction to the self-initializing variant of QS, including pseudo-
code and implementation and parameter tips. Also, comparisons of MPSQ and SIQS
to show that SIQS is at least twice as fast.


===============================================================================
QS-sieve
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Block sieving algorithms (Wambach, Wettig, 1995)

Description of a faster "double block" sieving algorithm for QS, which utilizes
the memory hierarchy in modern computers, achieving a speedup of up to 2.27.
Contains low-level implementation details and pseudocode.


===============================================================================
QS-results
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the factorization of RSA-120 (Denny, Dodson, A Lenstra, Mansse, 1994)

Report on the factorization of RSA-120 with description of the approach and
parameters. There's also a discussion about the crossover point between QS
and NFS.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The magic words are squeamish ossifrage (Brian Hayes, 1994)

A "popular scientific"-ish article about the decryption of the RSA challenge
given in 1977 in Martin Gardner's column in Scientific American, which meant
factoring a 129-digit integer. High-level description of the RSA cryptosystem
and the asymmetry between multiplication and factorization, and a description
of some of the easier factorization algorithms, ending in a description of the
quadratic sieve. The recent approach of distributing work to idle workstations
around the world is also mentioned.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The magic words are squeamish ossifrage (Atkins, Graff, A Lenstra, Leyland,
1995)

Report on the decryption of an RSA challenge that was given in 1977 in Martin
Gardner's column in Scientific American. Solving this challenge meant
factoring a 129-digit integer, which was known to be a product of a 64-digit
prime and a 65-digit prime with some additional properties that didn't expose
known RSA weaknesses. The approach, using MPQS with two large primes, is
described in detail, including parameter settings, time spent and how the
work was distributed. Early estimates (from the 70's) about the difficulty
of factoring large integers are mentioned, and how they were way off because
they didn't take into account significant algorithmic improvements. There is
a mention of the new asymptotically superior algorithm NFS which the authors
suspect will be the one that is used in future factorizations of large
integers. The magic words in the article title refers to the decrypted message.
===============================================================================
SNFS (Special number field sieve)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optimal parameterization of SNFS (Robert D Silverman, 2007)

A theoretical analysis that shows that a rectangular sieving region is not
optimal. In addition, there are guidelines for selecting parameters, and a nice
section with implementation tips.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Special number field sieve (Per Reidar Bøhler, 2008) [master's thesis]

A brief description of QS (basic variant) that leads into an explanation of the
SNFS algorithm. Contains numerical examples and has an outline of how to
implement the sieve step. There is run-time analysis for both QS and SNFS.
NFS gets a tiny mention near the end. Apart from the brief mention on how to
implement sieving, this is a mathematical document.


===============================================================================
SNFS-results
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The factorization of the ninth Fermat number (A Lenstra, H Lenstra, Manasse,
Pollard, 1993)

Report on the factorization of F_9=2^512+1. This is a long article, which also
includes history and factorization of other fermat numbers, previous
factorization attempts on F_9, a description of the basic techniques that
modern factoring algorithms are based on, a brief review of algebraic number
theory and a description of SNFS. Lastly, there is the report on the actual
factorization.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A kilobit special number field sieve factorization (Aoki, Franke, Kleinjung,
Lenstra, Osvik, 2007)

Description of how 2^1039-1 was factored. Also includes a description of the
Block Wiedemann algorithm for the matrix step.


===============================================================================
NFS ([General] number field sieve)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An implementation of the general number field sieve (Buchmann, Loho, Zayer,
1993)

Description of the implementation of NFS, using one large rational prime and
two large algebraic primes, lattice sieve and Couveignes' algebraic square root
algorithm which requires odd degree. There is also a short discussion on the
quality of the polynomials where all are close to base-m expansion. The
factored numbers are rather small (up to 49 digits).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NFS with four large primes: an explosive experiment (Dodson, A Lenstra, 1995)

Article which describes an experiment with 4 large primes (two on each side),
where it is discovered that the number of cycles from partials increase
dramatically after some threshold, but with some erratic behaviour. It is
concluded that NFS is more practically useful than previously thought.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An implementation of the number field sieve (Marije Elkenbracht-Huizing, 1996)

Contains a description of the standard algorithm and a high-level outline of
the implementation, followed by very detailed explanations of each step in
the algorithm, including Block Lanczos.
TODO reread this and check polynomial stuff
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An introduction to the general number field sieve (Matthew E Briggs, 1998)
[master's thesis]

Detailed description of the algorithm, including a lot of the mathematical
background, assumes some knowledge of abstract algebra. The easier variant is
chosen at each step. There is a long section describing the Lanczos algorithm
for real numbers, followed by a short section describing Block Lanczos. There
is a very detailed explanation of the math behind Couveignes' algebraic square
root algorithm, including subalgorithms such as finding square roots in F_p^d.
A very detailed example of a factorization is included, including the algebraic
square root step. In addition, there's a discussion of polynomial selection.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A beginner's guide to the general number field sieve (Michael Case, 2003)

A brief and simple explanation of the number field sieve that avoids hairy
details and proofs. Some knowledge about rings is beneficial for a better
understanding. Explains all steps of NFS except the algebraic square root,
and gives helpful implementation details. Contains a small example.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implementing the general number field sieve (Brent Bejot, 2009) [independent
study]

A very brief explanation of the number field sieve with pretty much no
additional mathematical background provided. The main focus is on the algebraic
square root algorithm (couveignes' algorithm), which has many details that
could be helpful when implementing. There is also some experiments with
sieving, with the observation that there might be more relations along straight
lines emanating from some center in the bottom of the sieve rectangle (the
intersection of the rational and algebraic sieve), and diagrams demonstrating
the phenomena. The implementation described was tested on very small numbers
(7 digits).


===============================================================================
NFS-polynomial selection
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On quadratic polynomials for the number field sieve (Murphy, Brent, 1997)

A variant of NFS with quadratic polynomials is considered, and the yield is
calculated for full relations, partial relations and partial-partials.
Apparently this approach can't compete with degree 5 polynomials for large
enough integers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Polynomial selection for the number field sieve integer factorisation
algorithm (Brian Antony Murphy, 1999) [phd thesis]

A method to find good polynomials, with good size and root properties is
developed. It also includes a technique to measure "goodness" of a polynomial
without sieving. A description of NFS is included, with mention of the needed
adjustments for non-monic polynomials to work.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On polynomial selection for the general number field sieve (Kleinjung, 2006)

An improvement to the polynomial selection algorithm by Montgomery and Murphy.
A step-by-step description of the algorithm is given.


===============================================================================
NFS-polynomial selection-polynomial factorization

After picking a polynomial f(x), we can get a factor of n if f(x) is reducible.
To obtain the factor we need to factor f(x).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Factoring polynomials with rational coefficients (A Lenstra, H Lenstra, Lovasz,
1982)

The classical polynomial-time algorithm for factoring polynomials over Z (and
Q). Very math-intensive, and contains pseudocode.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Factorization in Z[x]: the searching phase (John Abbott, 2000)

Improvement on a specific phase of the Berlekamp-Zassenhaus algorithm for
factoring polynomials in Z. It's probably overkill since the low degree of
number fields means that we can use much easier algorithms.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Polynomial factorization: a success story (Erich Kaltofen, 2003) [plenary
lecture]

A short article (really an introduction to a talk) which briefly describes some
of the highlight of the history of polynomial factorization. Contains a lot of
references.


===============================================================================
NFS-factor base generation-polynomial factorization over F_p

When generating the factor base for the algebraic side we need to find all
roots of f(x) (mod p) in order to find (p,r) pairs that represent prime ideals.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A new polynomial factorization algorithm and its implementation (Victor Shoup,
1995)

This is an algorithm capable of factoring polynomials of large degree
(thousands), and is probably overkill for the NFS where we merely want to find
roots of a polynomial of degree 5 or 6.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On a new factorization algorithm for polynomials over finite fields
(Niederreiter, Göttfert, 1995)

A polynomial-time algorithm for factoring polynomials over finite fields. The
description is very math-y, but this algorithm is probably overkill since only
roots are needed in NFS.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subquadratic-time factoring of polynomials over finite fields (Kaltofen,
Shoup, 1998)

A faster algorithm for factoring polynomials over finite fields. Probably
overkill since we are only interested in roots.


===============================================================================
NFS-sieve
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lattice sieving and trial division (Golliver, A Lenstra, McCurley, 1994)

A description of a faster variant of Pollard's lattice sieve, which also has
improvements in the trial division step. While the lattice sieve is
significantly harder to understand than the classical sieve, this paper is
easy to read and has a large focus on implementation with many details. There
is also a mention of implementation problems on machines with very little
memory, which seems obsolete today.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sieving using bucket sort (Aoki, Ueda, 2004)

An improvement to the classical sieve algorithm that reduces the number of
cache misses, which first collects the sieved numbers in "buckets" that are
afterwards used to update the sieve. It is mentioned without further discussion
that this method can be used with the lattice sieve.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Continued fractions and lattice sieving (Franke, Kleinjung, 2005)

Description of a new method of lattice sieving which is supposed to be faster
than traditional lattice sieving. Very difficult and math-heavy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the amount of sieving in factorization methods (Willemina Hendrika
Ekkelkamp, 2009) [phd thesis]

An asympotic approximation for smooth and almost-smooth numbers (with k
large primes) is derived (for both MPQS and NFS), and a practical approach
for estimating sieving time in NFS is obtained. Extremely math-heavy.


===============================================================================
NFS-filtering

Post-processing of the relations to create a smaller or lighter matrix.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the reduction of composed relations from the number field sieve (Denny,
Müller, 1995) [extended abstract]

An improvement to the cycle finding algorithm that finds fundamental cycles
with less partial relations involved, leading to a matrix with much lower
weight.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategies in filtering in the number field sieve (Stefania Cavallar, 2000)

Description of various methods used to remove and merge relations from the
matrix before running linear algebra.


===============================================================================
NFS-algebraic square root
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Square roots of products of algebraic numbers (Peter L Montgomery, 1993)

A new algorithm for computing the square root of an algebraic number, which is
more efficient than Couveignes' algorithm and works with even degrees. The
mathematics is extremely difficult and lengthy. The document appears to be
slightly unfinished (the front matter actually warns about lack of
proofreading). For example, one equation is marked as WRONG in a strange way,
and the example is slightly obsoleted by a revised version of the algorithm.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Montgomery-like square root for the number field sieve (Phong Nguyen, 1998)

Description of an algorithm that's faster than Couveignes' algorithm which
also works with number fields of even degrees. Extremely difficult. Has some
implementation tips.


===============================================================================
NFS-improvements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modifications to the number field sieve (Don Coppersmith, 1993)

A mathematical overview of NFS followed by an improvement with multiple
polynomials and a two-stage sieve. When everything is carefully balanced, the
asymptotic runtime of the number field sieve is improved from L[1/3,1.923] to
L[1/3,1.902]. Another improvement is suggested which involve choosing an m
(independently of the number N to be factored) and precalculate the entire
sieve a-mb for some a,b bounds and factor base limit, leading to an asymptotic
runtime of L[1/3,1.639]. Other authors have doubted that these improvements are
useful in practice for the range of N that we can hope to factor.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A multiple polynomial general number field sieze (Marije Elkenbracht-Huizing,
1996)

Description of a multiple polynomial variant of nfs, which achieves a small
speedup on a 95-digit number, except when using 3 or 4 polynomials with the
lattice sieve.


===============================================================================
NFS-results
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A world wide number field sieve factoring record: on to 512 bits (Cowie,
Dodson, Elkenbracht-Huizing, Lenstra, Montgomery, Zayer, 1996)

Detailed description of the approach used in the factorization of RSA-130,
the first NFS record, with the sieve stage distributed globally over the web.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Factorization of RSA-140 using the number field sieve (Cavallar, Dodson,
A Lenstra, Leyland, Lioen, Montgomery, Murphy, Riele, Zimmermann, 1999)

Report on the factorization of RSA-140. In addition there's a discussion on
how far away the factorization of a 512-bit RSA modulus is. There is a large
emphasis on the polynomial selection, which explains how to look for "skewed"
polynomials with good root properties.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GNFS factoring statistics of RSA-100, 100, ..., 150 (Aoki, Kida, Shimoyama,
Ueda, 2004)

6 RSA numbers were factored using the same implementation, and polynomials,
parameters and various statistics are presented, and pretty much nothing else.
The statistics are pretty detailed, and include the number of relations of
various types, and statistics from various stages in the filtering as well as
time spent in the various phases.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Factorization of a 768-bit RSA modulus (Aoki, Franke, A Lenstra, Thomé, Bos,
Gaudry, Kruppa, Montgomery, Osvik, Riele, Timofeev, Zimmermann, 2010)

Description of the approach used in the factorization of RSA-768, along with
a description of the algorithm. Many practical details, implementation tips
and description of improvements are included. A high level explanation of
Block Wiedemann is included.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Factorization of RSA-704 with CADO-NFS (Bai, Thomé, Zimmermann, 2012)

Report on the factorization of RSA-704. Very high level with no implementation
details, but mentions of parameter settings and programs used (existing free
software were used).


===============================================================================
LINEAR ALGEBRA

Solve a system of linear equations modulo 2 aka find subset of relations such
that their product is a square.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solving sparse linear equations over finite fields (Douglas H Wiedemann, 1986)

An original algorithm for solving systems over finite fields.  Rather difficult
and math-intensive.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solving large sparse linear systems over finite fields (LaMacchia, Odlyzko,
1991)

Thorough description of several algorithms for solving linear systems (Lanczos,
Wiedemann, structured Gaussian elimination) and comparison between them when
used to solve systems modulo large primes and modulo 2. Structured Gaussian
elimination is less mathematical and more "experimental" in nature than the
other algorithms, and can be used to reduce the size of the system before it
is solved with another algorithm (like Lanczos). At the time of publication,
NFS was thought to require the system to be solved over the integers, and one
way to do it was to solve the system modulo several large primes, and use
Chinese Remainder Theorem to obtain the final result.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solving linear systems over GF(2): Block Lanczos algorithm (Don Coppersmith,
1993)

Modification to the Lanczos algorithm to work modulo 2, which uses blocking to
perform 32-bit operations for the cost of one. Problems when adapting Lanczos
to modulo 2 are addressed (zero division by dot product that can become 0
modulo 2) with a method that avoids embedding GF(2) into GF(2^k). Pseudocode
is given. Pretty difficult and math-intensive.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solving homogeneous linear equations over GF(2) via Block Wiedemann algorithm
(Don Coppersmith, 1994)

Describes an algorithm for solving a linear system of equations modulo 2, which
is an adaption of the Wiedemann algorithm that uses bitwise operations on whole
words, as well as overcoming the difficulty of making a blocked version of a
needed sub-algorithm, the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm. Implementation details
are given. Very difficult and math-intensive.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Block Lanczos algorithm for finding dependencies over GF(2) (Peter L
Montgomery, 1995)

Describes an algorithm for solving a linear system of equations modulo 2,
which is an improvement over the Lanczos algorithm that utilizes bitwise
operations on whole words. Pretty difficult and math-heavy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blocked iterative sparse linear system solveds for finite fields (Erich
Kaltofen, 1996) [extended abstract]

A short "survey" on different iterative linear equation solvers that mentions
Block Wiedemann and Block Lanczos.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parallel Block Lanczos for solving large binary systems (Michael Peterson,
2006) [master's thesis]

Description of montgomery's and coppersmith's variants of block lanczos over
F_2, and a description of their own adaption of Lanczos over F_2. Pretty math-
intensive, and pseudocode is provided. A way to implement a parallel version is
discussed. It is unknown whether the new approach is competitive.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A randomized algorithm for linear equations over prime fields (Prasad
Raghavendra, 2012) [draft paper]

A new algorithm for solving linear equations in prime fields, and
pseudocode is provided. The algorithm looks significantly simpler than Block
Lanczos and Block Wiedemann. It is unknown whether this approach is
competitive. Further explanation and more comments here:

quantum computer (Peter W Shor, 1996)

computer. Not currently practical.
