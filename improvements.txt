improvements to consider

ECM

alpertron's implementation has a lot of montgomery multiplication stuff in it,
investigate

QS

sieve around floor(sqrt(n)), then sieve around floor(sqrt(2n)) etc for
increasing kn

filtering: remove duplicate relations and if a prime occurs once, remove the
relation containing it. if a prime occurs in two relations, merge them. if a
prime occurs in 3 relations, they can be merged into 2 relations.

LINEAR ALGEBRA

check out if the "null space algorithm" [knuth vol 2 page 444] is useful

implement the algorithm from Raghavendra
