improvements to consider

ECM

alpertron's implementation has a lot of montgomery multiplication stuff in it,
investigate

QS

multiply n by a small constant, to skew the factor base towards smaller primes.
minimize the log sum of primes of something like that, check that paper again.

sieve around floor(sqrt(n)), then sieve around floor(sqrt(2n)) etc for
increasing kn

multiple polynomials!

siqs!

one large prime

two large primes

filtering: remove duplicate relations and if a prime occurs once, remove the
relation containing it. if a prime occurs in two relations, merge them. if a
prime occurs in 3 relations, they can be merged into 2 relations.

LINEAR ALGEBRA

check out if the "null space algorithm" [knuth vol 2 page 444] is useful
for something.

implement the algorithm from Raghavendra
